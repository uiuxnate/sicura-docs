Operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
Cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Network devices (e.g., firewalls, routers)
Applications (e.g., web servers, databases)
</td><td>Unlike CIS controls which are very generic, CIS Benchmarks are very specific recommendations for secure system configurations. CIS Benchmarks are a critical step for implementing CIS Controls because each CIS Benchmark recommendation refers to one or more of the CIS Controls.
For example, CIS Control 3 suggests secure hardware and software configurations for computer systems. CIS Benchmarks provide vendor-neutral and vendor-specific guidance along with detailed instructions that admins can follow to implement CIS Control
Overall they provide a globally recognized set of security best practices and configuration guidelines, developed by cybersecurity experts, which helps organizations establish a strong security posture by minimizing vulnerabilities and mitigating cyber threats across their IT systems, ensuring compliance with industry regulations, and promoting a structured approach to system hardening without the need for trial-and-error configuration decisions.

Basic Controls (which address foundational aspects of cybersecurity like asset management and vulnerability management)
Foundational Controls (focused on improving monitoring, defenses, and secure configurations)
Organizational Controls (which aim to enhance governance, incident response, and overall organizational readiness for cybersecurity)
There are currently 18 CIS Controls (as of the latest version), each with specific action items that organizations can implement to protect themselves against cyber threats. These controls are widely recognized and used by businesses, governments, and institutions across the globe to enhance their cybersecurity programs.
</td><td>The CIS Controls are important because they minimize the risk of data breaches, data leaks, theft of intellectual property, corporate espionage, identity theft, privacy loss, denial of service and other cyber threats.
As security professionals, we have access to an array of security tools and technologies, security standards, training, certifications, vulnerability databases, best practices, security controls, checklists, benchmarks and recommendations. 
The CIS Controls have evolved from the consensus list of security controls that security experts believe are the best defensive techniques to prevent data breaches and mitigate the damage caused by cyber attacks.
Beyond blocking the unauthorized access, the CIS controls also address detecting indicators of compromise and preventing additional attacks.
The CIS Controls help us answer questions like: 
What are the most critical areas to establish a risk management program?
Which defensive steps provide the greatest value?
How can we track our risk management program maturity?
How can we share our insights into attacks and attackers and identify root causes?
Which tools are best used to solve which problems?
